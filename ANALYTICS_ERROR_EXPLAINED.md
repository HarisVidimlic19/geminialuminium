## üéì Advanced: Why ERR_ADDRESS_INVALID?

### Technical Explanation:

When an ad blocker blocks Google Analytics:
1. Your code tries to send a POST request to google-analytics.com
2. The ad blocker **intercepts** the request
3. Instead of a normal failure (404, 403), it **blocks the DNS resolution**
4. The browser can't find the IP address for google-analytics.com
5. Result: `net::ERR_ADDRESS_INVALID` (address couldn't be resolved)

**It's not your code - it's the ad blocker doing its job!**

---

## ‚úÖ Final Verdict

**Your Google Analytics implementation is CORRECT.** ‚úÖ

The error you're seeing is:
- ‚úÖ Normal for websites with analytics
- ‚úÖ Caused by browser extensions/privacy settings
