# Final Updates - Navigation, Logo, Icons, and One-Man Business

## ‚úÖ Issues Fixed

### 1. **Navigation Links Fixed** üîó
**Problem**: Missing slash caused URLs like `http://localhost:4321/GeminiHomeImprovementsservices`

**Solution**: Added trailing slash to all navigation links
```astro
href={`${baseUrl}services/`}  // Now has trailing slash
```

**Updated Locations**:
- Header navigation (6 links)
- Footer quick links (3 links)
- All internal page links

**Result**: URLs now properly formatted as `/GeminiHomeImprovements/services/`

---

### 2. **Logo Display Fixed** üé®
**Problem**: Logo showed alt text "Gemini Home Improvements Logo" instead of actual image

**Root Cause**: Logo file wasn't successfully copied to `public/logo.svg`

**Solution**: 
- Properly copied `SVGLogo.svg` ‚Üí `public/logo.svg`
- Verified file exists with `Test-Path`
- Logo now displays in header

**Visual Result**: Professional logo image appears in header navigation (60px height)

### 3. **Icons Replaced with Segoe Fluent Icons** ‚ú®

| &#xE707; | e707 | MapPin | Contact page location |
| &#xE734; | e734 | Toolbox | Team page (quality) |

#### Implementation:
```css
.icon {
  font-family: 'Segoe Fluent Icons', 'Segoe MDL2 Assets';
  font-size: 1.5rem;
  color: var(--accent-color);
}
```
