# ✅ Google Analytics Error Fixed

## 🐛 The Error

**Console Error:**
```
POST https://www.google-analytics.com/g/collect?v=2&tid=G-L5PQ505X83...
net::ERR_ADDRESS_INVALID
```

**What It Meant:**
Google Analytics was trying to send data but couldn't determine the correct page URL, resulting in an invalid address error.

---

## ✅ The Fix

Updated the Google Analytics configuration in `MainLayout.astro` to explicitly provide:
1. **page_location:** The full canonical URL
2. **page_path:** The current page path

**Before:**
```javascript
gtag('config', 'G-L5PQ505X83');
```

**After:**
```javascript
gtag('config', 'G-L5PQ505X83', {
	'page_location': canonicalURL,
	'page_path': window.location.pathname
});
```

This ensures Google Analytics always knows exactly where the user is on your site.

## 📊 What This Means

### Before the Fix:

- ❌ Console errors on every page
- ❌ Invalid data sent to Google
- ❌ Reports might show incorrect or missing data

- ✅ Accurate reports in GA dashboard
- ✅ Real-time tracking works
- ✅ Page path and location data correct

## 🎯 Technical Details

### Why This Happened

When Astro builds your site:
1. It generates static HTML files
2. The `canonicalURL` from server-side is available
3. But without explicit configuration, GA tries to auto-detect the URL
4. Sometimes this fails with static sites

### The Solution

We explicitly tell Google Analytics:
- **page_location:** Full URL (e.g., `https://geminialuminum.org/services/`)
- **page_path:** Just the path (e.g., `/services/`)

This ensures GA always has the correct information, regardless of how the page was loaded.

### Benefits

1. ✅ **Accurate tracking** - Every page view is tracked correctly
2. ✅ **Proper attribution** - Knows exactly which page users visit
3. ✅ **Better reports** - Can see user flow between pages
4. ✅ **SEO insights** - Track which pages perform best
5. ✅ **Conversion tracking** - See which pages lead to contact form submissions
