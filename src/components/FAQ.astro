			<div class="faq-item">
				<h3>What are leaf guards and do I need them?</h3>
				<p>Leaf guards (gutter guards) prevent leaves and debris from clogging your eavestroughs, reducing maintenance and preventing water damage. They're especially beneficial for homes near trees in the Toronto area.</p>
			</div>

				<h3>How long does eavestrough installation take?</h3>
				<p>Most residential eavestrough installations in Toronto take 1-2 days depending on home size. We work efficiently to minimize disruption to your daily routine.</p>

			<div class="faq-item">
				<h3>What's the difference between regular gutters and seamless eavestroughs?</h3>
				<p>Seamless eavestroughs are custom-formed on-site with no joints or seams, reducing leaks and improving appearance. They're more durable and require less maintenance than sectional gutters.</p>
			</div>
			
			<div class="faq-item">
				<h3>How often should eavestroughs be cleaned?</h3>
				<p>In Toronto, we recommend cleaning eavestroughs twice yearly - spring and fall. However, with our leaf guard systems, maintenance can be reduced to once per year or less.</p>
