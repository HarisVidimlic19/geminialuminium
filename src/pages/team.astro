					<h2>Professional, Personal Service</h2>
					<p>
						As the owner and sole operator of Gemini Home Improvements, I bring over 15 years 
						of hands-on experience to every project. When you work with me, you get direct 
						communication with the person who will actually be doing the work - no middlemen, 
						no subcontractors, just reliable, quality service.
					</p>
					<p>
						I founded Gemini Home Improvements in 2008 with a commitment to providing homeowners 
						in the Greater Toronto Area with honest, quality exterior renovation services at fair 
						prices. That commitment remains the foundation of my business today.
					</p>
					<p>
						Every consultation, estimate, and installation receives my personal attention. I take 
						pride in my work and stand behind every project with a quality guarantee. Your satisfaction 
						is not just my goal - it's my reputation.
