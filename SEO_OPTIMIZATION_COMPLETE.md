**Important:** Update with your real phone number and add actual address if you want to show it.

#### 1.2 Optimize Page Titles for Keywords

**Critical for SEO:** Title tags are the #1 ranking factor.

**Update each page's title:**

**Home Page (`src/pages/index.astro`):**
```astro
<MainLayout 
	title="Eavestrough Installation Toronto | Leaf Guards & Siding | Gemini Home Improvements"
	description="Professional eavestrough installation, leaf guards, and exterior renovation in Toronto & GTA. Over 15 years experience. Free estimates. Call today!"
	keywords="eavestrough installation toronto, leaf guards, gutter guards, downspouts, siding installation, exterior renovation, gta, mississauga, brampton"
/>
```

**Services Page (`src/pages/services.astro`):**
```astro
<MainLayout 
	title="Services: Eavestrough, Leaf Guards, Siding | Toronto GTA | Gemini"
	description="Expert eavestrough installation, seamless gutters, leaf guard systems, vinyl siding, and aluminum capping. Serving Toronto, Mississauga, Brampton. Free quotes!"
	keywords="eavestrough repair, gutter installation, leaf guard installation, vinyl siding toronto, aluminum capping, fascia repair, soffit installation"
/>
```

**Projects Page (`src/pages/projects.astro`):**
```astro
<MainLayout 
	title="Eavestrough & Siding Projects | Before & After | Toronto | Gemini"
	description="View our completed eavestrough, leaf guard, and exterior renovation projects in Toronto & GTA. Quality workmanship with lasting results."
	keywords="eavestrough projects toronto, before after gutters, siding projects, exterior renovation portfolio, gta home improvement"
/>
```

**Contact Page (`src/pages/contact.astro`):**
```astro
<MainLayout 
	title="Free Quote: Eavestrough, Leaf Guards, Siding | Toronto | Gemini"
	description="Get a free quote for eavestrough installation, leaf guards, or exterior renovation in Toronto & GTA. Fast response, quality work. Contact us today!"
	keywords="free eavestrough quote toronto, leaf guard estimate, siding quote gta, contact exterior renovation"
/>
```

#### 1.3 Optimize Image Alt Tags (Critical for Image Search)

**Update `src/pages/projects.astro`** - Add keyword-rich alt tags:

```astro
<img 
	src={`${baseUrl}/images/carousel/slide2.jpg`} 
	alt="Complete exterior renovation eavestrough siding Toronto GTA professional installation" 
	class="project-image" 
	loading="lazy" 
/>

<img 
	src={`${baseUrl}/images/carousel/slide1.jpg`} 
	alt="European style eavestrough installation custom leaf guard system Toronto" 
	class="project-image" 
	loading="lazy" 
/>

<img 
	src={`${baseUrl}/images/carousel/slide3.jpg`} 
	alt="Seamless eavestrough downspout installation GTA exterior renovation project" 
	class="project-image" 
	loading="lazy" 
/>
```

**Pattern for alt tags:**
- Include primary keyword (eavestrough, leaf guard, siding)
- Include location (Toronto, GTA, Mississauga)
- Be descriptive but natural
- 100-125 characters optimal

#### 1.4 Add Geo Meta Tags

**Add to `MainLayout.astro` in `<head>`:

```astro
<!-- Geo Targeting -->
<meta name="geo.region" content="CA-ON" />
<meta name="geo.placename" content="Toronto" />
<meta name="geo.position" content="43.6532;-79.3832" />
<meta name="ICBM" content="43.6532, -79.3832" />
```

### Phase 2: Content Optimization (High Impact - 1 hour)

#### 2.1 Add H1/H2/H3 Hierarchy with Keywords

**Add to home page** (`src/pages/index.astro`):
```astro
import ServiceAreas from '../components/ServiceAreas.astro';

<!-- Add before footer -->

```

#### 2.3 Create FAQ Section (Excellent for SEO)

**Create** `src/components/FAQ.astro`:

```astro
---
---

<section class="faq-section">
	<div class="container">
		<h2>Frequently Asked Questions About Eavestrough & Exterior Services</h2>
		
		<div class="faq-grid">
			<div class="faq-item">
				<h3>How much does eavestrough installation cost in Toronto?</h3>
				<p>Eavestrough installation costs vary based on home size and materials. We provide free, no-obligation quotes for all projects in the GTA. Contact us for a personalized estimate.</p>
			</div>
			
			<div class="faq-item">
				<h3>What are leaf guards and do I need them?</h3>
				<p>Leaf guards (gutter guards) prevent leaves and debris from clogging your eavestroughs, reducing maintenance and preventing water damage. They're especially beneficial for homes near trees in the Toronto area.</p>
			</div>
			
			<div class="faq-item">
				<h3>How long does eavestrough installation take?</h3>
				<p>Most residential eavestrough installations in Toronto take 1-2 days depending on home size. We work efficiently to minimize disruption to your daily routine.</p>
			</div>
			
			<div class="faq-item">
				<h3>Do you service areas outside Toronto?</h3>
				<p>Yes! We provide eavestrough, leaf guard, and siding services throughout the Greater Toronto Area including Mississauga, Brampton, Vaughan, Markham, Richmond Hill, Oakville, and Burlington.</p>
			</div>
			
			<div class="faq-item">
				<h3>What's the difference between regular gutters and seamless eavestroughs?</h3>
				<p>Seamless eavestroughs are custom-formed on-site with no joints or seams, reducing leaks and improving appearance. They're more durable and require less maintenance than sectional gutters.</p>
			</div>
			
			<div class="faq-item">
				<h3>How often should eavestroughs be cleaned?</h3>
				<p>In Toronto, we recommend cleaning eavestroughs twice yearly - spring and fall. However, with our leaf guard systems, maintenance can be reduced to once per year or less.</p>
			</div>
		</div>
	</div>
