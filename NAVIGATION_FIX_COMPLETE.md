# ✅ FIXED: Logo and Navigation Issues Resolved

## 🔧 What Was Broken

### Issue #1: Logo Not Displaying
The logo in the header wasn't showing up.

**Cause:** Path was `${baseUrl}/logo.svg` which with `base: '/'` became `//logo.svg` (double slash)

### Issue #2: Navigation Links Opening Incorrectly  
Clicking navigation links opened weird tabs like `/services` without localhost or domain.

**Cause:** When `base: '/'`, template literals like `${baseUrl}/services/` became `//services/`
- The `//` makes browsers think it's a protocol-relative URL
- Opens as external link in new tab/context

---

## ✅ The Fix

Changed ALL navigation links from template literals to simple absolute paths:

**BEFORE (Broken):**
```astro
<a href={`${baseUrl}/services/`}>Services</a>
<img src={`${baseUrl}/logo.svg`} />
```

**AFTER (Working):**
```astro
<a href="/services/">Services</a>
<img src="/logo.svg" />
```

## 📝 Technical Note

### Why Absolute Paths Work Better

For sites deployed at root (`base: '/'`):
- ✅ `/services/` = Clean, always works
- ❌ `${baseUrl}/services/` when baseUrl='/' = `//services/` = Broken

**Your config:**
```javascript
site: 'https://geminialuminum.org'
base: '/'
```

**Result:** Absolute paths (`/services/`) are the correct approach.
