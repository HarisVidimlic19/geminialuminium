## üîß Technical Details

### Phone Number Obfuscation
Your phone number is obfuscated using character codes (same method as contact page):
```javascript
const phoneCodes = [52,49,54,51,53,55,55,55,49,54]; // Your number
```

This appears in:
- Footer (MainLayout.astro)
- Privacy Policy page
- Schema.org JSON-LD (dynamically injected)
- Contact page (already implemented)

**Why?** Protects from web scrapers and spam bots while allowing search engines to read it.

### Address Implementation
Schema.org shows:
- Street: Empty (as requested)
- City: Brantford
- Province: ON
- Postal: Empty (as requested)
- Country: CA

You can update this later if you want to show full address.

### Schema.org Updates
The Schema.org script dynamically injects the phone number on page load using JavaScript. This means:
- Phone is NOT visible in HTML source (protected from scrapers)
- Google can still read it (JavaScript executes)
- Same security as your contact page
